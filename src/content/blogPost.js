  <div class="p-4 border-l-4 border-[#FC6B57] bg-[#FFF8F7] rounded shadow mb-6">
    <strong>Smart Spending:</strong> Mix and match your splurges. DIY where possible, and look for bundled deals from venues or entertainers.
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Step 6 – Build a Timeline to Keep Everything on Track</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">One of the easiest ways to stay on top of how to plan a children’s party is to spread tasks out over several weeks.</p>

  <div class="bg-[#FFF3F0] p-4 rounded-lg border border-[#FC6B57] mb-6">
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-[#2F2F2F]">
      <li><strong>8–6 weeks before:</strong> Choose a date and time that works for your family and book your venue, especially if you're aiming for one of the more popular locations. It's also a good time to settle on a party theme and start researching entertainers so you’re not left scrambling.</li>
      <li><strong>5–4 weeks before:</strong> Send invitations, whether printed or digital, and confirm your chosen entertainer. Begin planning food options and think about your decorations. If you’re making party bags, gather the items you’ll include.</li>
      <li><strong>3–2 weeks before:</strong> Follow up on RSVPs and finalize your guest list. Decide on the birthday cake, whether baking it yourself or ordering one. Ask any friends or family to help on the day, and begin working out your activity schedule.</li>
      <li><strong>1 week before:</strong> Do a final supply shop, prepare party bags, and check your decorations are ready to go. Confirm all the logistics with your venue and entertainer to avoid last-minute surprises.</li>
      <li><strong>The night before:</strong> Pack a box with essentials like candles, matches, bin bags, wipes, and plasters. Review your party checklist to make sure you're all set.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Step 7 – Plan the Activities & Entertainment Schedule</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">No matter the size of your guest list, having a rough plan for activities can help the day flow smoothly.</p>

  <h3 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Activity Ideas by Age Group</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-[#2F2F2F] mb-4">
    <li><strong>Kids 3 to 5:</strong> For ages 3 to 5, keep things simple and sensory. Storytime corners, bubble machines, musical statues, or a themed craft table work well. A puppet show or a sing-along entertainer is also likely to be a big hit.</li>
    <li><strong>Kids 6 to 8:</strong> Children aged 6 to 8 often enjoy more interactive games and creative challenges. Think treasure hunts, mini obstacle courses, or team-based party games. Face painting or a magician fits beautifully at this age.</li>
    <li><strong>Kids 9 to 10:</strong> For those aged 9 to 10, you can go a little more adventurous. Karaoke, dance-offs, slime-making, or even a mini quiz based on their favourite TV shows make brilliant children’s birthday party ideas for this age group. At-home discos or party games with prizes work well too.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="p-4 border-l-4 border-[#FC6B57] bg-[#FFF8F7] rounded shadow mb-6">
    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Allow space for free play or low-key activities. Have a loose structure, a welcome activity, followed by the main entertainment, then food, and finally cake and wind-down games. The best parties strike a balance between energy and ease.
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Step 8 – The Finishing Touches</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">This part of children’s party planning London parents often overlook, but it can make all the difference on the day.</p>

  <h3 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What to Prepare Ahead</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-[#2F2F2F] mb-6">
    <li>Simple, child-friendly food — sandwiches, fruit, crisps, sweet treats</li>
    <li>Birthday cake — homemade, store-bought, or custom ordered</li>
    <li>Decorations — balloons, bunting, themed props</li>
    <li>Extras — music playlist, utensils, wipes, bin bags, napkins</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Optional Magic Touches</h3>
